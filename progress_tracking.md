## Current Focus: Phase 2-3 - MVP Implementation

### Recently Completed:
1. âœ… **Streamlit Web Application**: Full-featured web interface with search and filtering
2. âœ… **Database Integration**: Fixed SQLite compatibility issues and database initialization  
3. âœ… **Real-time Scraping**: UI-triggered article collection and processing
4. âœ… **Article Processing**: Working summarization and entity extraction pipeline
5. âœ… **Search Functionality**: Basic text search across title, content, and summary
6. âœ… **Date Filtering**: Filter articles by publication date range
7. âœ… **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in scrapers and database operations

### Current Status:
- **MVP is now LIVE and functional** ðŸŽ‰
- Application running on http://localhost:8501
- SQLite database with working article storage
- Guardian scraper operational with keyword filtering
- Basic NLP processing pipeline working

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Add More News Sources**: Activate Bloomberg, Reuters scrapers
